Welcome to the **World Spotlight** feature on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/worldbuilding)! This website contains some additional information on the World Spotlight, how to apply and how to conduct your spotlight.

## What is Spotlight?

The World Spotlight is a way of showcasing the best worlds the community has to offer and allow members to engage with their creators! Once or twice a week, one of our members is given the floor for up to 48 hours to present their world to the community and engage in a Q&A. It's a great way to get feedback, critique, and thoughtful questions for your world!

Anyone can join to ask questions or chat with the creator, and all members are invited to apply if they want to host a Spotlight!

## Want to feature your own world in a Spotlight?

Everyone is invited to apply! To be selected as a Spotlight Host, you must be an active member of the Discord worldbuilding server and not have a moderative record (warnings or tempbans) in the 3 months prior to your Spotlight Host date.

## When do spotlights happen?

Spotlights happen once or twice a week, depending on the number of applications. At the end of each month, we will post the schedule for the next month's spotlights in #world-spotlight (you can usually find the schedule pinned in that channel).

## How are Spotlight Hosts chosen?

The host for each week is chosen by random lottery. By filling in an application, you are signing up for that lottery. On the third week of each month, the four hosts for the following month are selected and announced. (For example: the hosts for September are chosen in the the third week of August). This announcement tells the hosts what order they present in, so that each person knows which week is their week.

## Can I talk in #world-spotlight? Can I ask questions to the Host?

Absolutely! Spotlights are meant to be interactive Q&As with other server members! Just make sure that you keep the focus on the Host's world&mdash;don't try to overtake the conversation or bring your own conversation into the channel. Check the rules in #welcome-rules-etc for our general and spotlight-specific rules.

## Can I get notifications when Spotlights are happening?

Yes! You can type `.spotlight join` in any text channel on Discord. You will get a PM from KazTron to confirm that you've been added. After this, you will receive notifications by hosts and the Moderators for the start of each Spotlight, announcement of the schedule, etc.

To stop getting notifications, type `.spotlight leave`. KazTron will confirm by PM again.
