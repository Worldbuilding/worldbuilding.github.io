summary: "The Welcome cog welcomes new users to the server publicly and allows moderators to more easily keep track of new users."

The Welcome cog welcomes new users to the server publicly (this avoids the terrible welcome messages that Discord's built-in feature uses), and logs these new users to #bot-output to be able to monitor for suspicious activity, such as impersonation or ban evasion.

It has no usable commands.
