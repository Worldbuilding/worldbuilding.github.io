## 3. tempban

Tempban a user.

This method will automatically create a modnote. It will not communicate with the user.

This module integrates with modnotes, and will automatically enforce "temp" notes, giving a role to users with unexpired "temp" notes and removing that role when the note expires. This command is shorthand for `.notes add <user> temp expires="[expires]" [Reason]`.

**Usage:** `.tempban <user> [expires=datespec] [reason]`

**Arguments:**
* `<user>`: The user to ban. See [modnotes: .notes](modnotes.html#1-notes) for more information.
* `[expires=datespec]`: Optional. The datespec for the tempban's expiration. Use quotation marks if the datespec has spaces in it. See [modnotes: .notes add](modnotes.html#11-add) for more information on accepted syntaxes. Default is `expires="in 7 days"`.
* `[reason]`: Optional, but highly recommended to specify. The reason to record in the modnote

**Channels:** Mod and bot channels

**Usable by:** Moderators only

**Examples:**
* `.tempban @BlitheringIdiot#1234 Was being a blithering idiot.` - Issues a 7-day ban.
* `.tempban @BlitheringIdiot#1234 expires="in 3 days" Was being a slight blithering idiot only.` - Issues a 3-day ban.


## 4. whois
